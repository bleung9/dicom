The two controllers that handle requests are in `app/controllers`. Saved images are found in `storage`.

There are various comments in the code that are relevant to the submission. Please read them.

This project uses a ruby gem called `dicom` to handle operations on DICOM images. There is a interface to convert .dcm files to other formats, but it has a dependency on another ruby gem which failed to install. This may be due to an OS upgrade I did on my machine. The line of code that would otherwise do the format conversion is `app/controllers/images_controller.rb:34`. Currently, the GET `images` endpoint is loading a pre-saved file in the `storage` folder.

Tests are found in `spec/requests` and can be run w/ the above command.

The following Postman screenshots show how to use this app.
